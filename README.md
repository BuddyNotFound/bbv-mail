> **[BBV X WORLD | MAIL](http://bbv.world)**

**BBV X WORLD - Mail**, Is a simple script that allows you to send items across the map using Postal Lockers, Thanks to **[BzZzi](https://forum.cfx.re/u/BzZzi)** for creating and letting me use the prop.

Script works with **QBCore** and **QB/OX** Inventory | **QB/OX** Menus and **QB/OX/BT** Target.
You will also need the prop for the script to work correctly [**THE PROP**](https://forum.cfx.re/t/prop-shop-locker/5148437), don't worry the prop is free.
